# Examples

This directory contains some examples of the library in action, including a sequence of to-do list apps of increasing complexity (see `todos1.py` through `todos5.py`, along with `adv_app.py`). For more examples of different applications and components, see the separate [examples repository](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fasthtml-example).
